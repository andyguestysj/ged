### Game Engines & Scripting

Scripting is writing very high level logic. In older game engines there was a distinction between the engine code, which created a tool and the scripting which was used to actually program things like "pushing this level opens that door."  

Scripting languages generally simpler and protected from making bugs lower down in the code, but also much slower and more limited then full programming languages like C/C++.  

Modern high level languages however have broken that distinction. You can write a game engine in C#, for instance, or use it as a scripting language, or both. "Managed" languages like C# and Java really combine the best attributes of both kinds of coding and distinct scripting languages are really fading away in the game space.
