## Detecting Collisions After The Fact

*A Posteriori* collision detection, in its simplest form, updates the positions of objects within the scene and then checks for collisions.  

### End Location Comparisons

There are a number of methods for doing this, the simplest is a comparison of the final locations of each object looking for overlaps. There are a number of techniques for doing this.  

#### 2D

##### Tiles
##### Bounding Circles
##### Bounding Squares
##### Separating Axis Theorem

#### Tunnelling Problem

#### Collision Performance

##### Broad Phase
##### Narrow Phase
