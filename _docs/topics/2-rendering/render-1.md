### Rendering

Rendering is the process by which an image is created from a mathematical model of information. This process is relatively simple for pure 2D rendering but more complex for 3D rendering (and often 3D renderers are used for 2D rendering).  

There are a number of techniques used for rendering, the most commonly used are rasterisation, raycasting and raytracing.  

Most game engine use an existing graphics library to store the contents of the game world (and provide fast graphics rendering), most commonly used are OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX.
