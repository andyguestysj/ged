## Introduction

In a nutshell, this module explores a number of different software component commonly found within 3d game engines. The module will also provide you with an opportunity to develop one or more game engine components.   

The module aims to:
* Improve your understanding of game engines
* Improve your programming prowess

## Learning Outcomes

1. Apply appropriate concepts, principles and approaches to games engine development;
2. Critically evaluate different approaches to game engine development using appropriate techniques
3. Effectively communicate a systematic understanding of the core principles of Game Engine development
