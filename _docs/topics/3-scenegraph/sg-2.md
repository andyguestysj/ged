### What is stored in a scene graph?

* objects
* appearance
* camera
* lights
  
**Geometry in the Scene Graph**  

* Leafs are basic 3D objects
* Non-leaf nodes (groups) contain a transformation
  * can have one or several children
  * transformation is given by a homogeneous Matrix
* Root is the entire world
* Nodes can be the child of several groups
  * not a tree, but a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  * effective reuse of geometry

**Appearance in the Scene Graph**

* Scene graph also contains appearances
  * Appearance: E.g. Color, reflection, transparency, texture
  * can be reused similarly to geometry
* Appearance can be only partially specified
  * unspecified values are inherited

**Lights in the Scene Graph**  

* Light sources also need a position and/or direction
  * Just include them into the scene graph
  * Can be animated just like geometry
* Lights can be in local coordinate systems of geometry groups
  * move with them
  * example: lights on a car

**The Camera in the Scene Graph**  

* Camera also needs a position and direction
  * Just include it into the scene graph
  * Can be animated just like geometry
* Camera can be in local coordinate systems of geometry groups
  * move with them
  * example: driverâ€˜s view from a car
