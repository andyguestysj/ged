With the ongoing Covid pandemic teaching has had to change from the standard classroom based lecture and labs approach. You are required to attend the online lab sessions on Tuesdays at 10-12.

For this module there will be no formal lectures presented live to the class. Instead the course material will be provided each week in advance of the scheduled lab session. This website will contain all the materials for the module.  

**You are expected to research and learn the techniques necessary to build the game engine component you choose. The course materials will give you a start and point you in the right direction but will not contain everything you need.**

Keep in mind that the component you choose may not be discussed until later in the semester. You will need to start researching it straight away.  

The lab sessions will contain discussion of concepts and game engine components as well as the chance to ask any questions you may have.
