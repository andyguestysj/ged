Choose one of the topics below or talk to me about another option and we'll see what we can work out.  

## 3D Renderer
Generate, and display, a still image based on a 3D render (using ray tracing) of a simple scene. The scene must include at least three spheres of different sizes and colours and a point light source. The image should show reflections and shadows.   
This does not have to run in real time. It should offer a system to allow the user to render the scene from different positions/angles.  

**Optional Extras**
Multiple light sources, different types of light sources. Transparency. Materials.

## 2D Physics
Design and implement a simple 2d physics engine that can handle circle shaped objects that have mass and are subject to gravity, friction, inertia and collisions with each other and the ground.  

**Optional Extras**
Other shapes, walls, springs.

## Terrain Generator
Design and implement a terrain generator. It must have customisable options.

## Particle Effect
Design and build a particle effect generator, e.g. smoke or fire. Must have customisable options.

## Flocking
Design and build a flocking demonstration of dots moving according to flocking behaviour. Should be customisable.

**Optional Extras**
Shapes instead of dots. Animated shapes. Walls. Predator.

## L-System
Design and build a L-System demonstration. e.g Ferns, trees, roots, etc. Customisable ruleset.
