### Choosing An Engine

### Engine, Frameworks, Libraries, DIY?

### Things To Consider

* 2D or 3D or ? (inc VR/AR)
* Development Platform - Which system(s) will you be developing on?
* Target/Build Platforms - Which system(s) will you be developing for? Are there any compromises to enable multi-plaform builds?
* Performance - Will your game be demanding on the platform? Do you require an optimised/optimisable engine?
* Graphics Detail - Will the engine support/optimise the level of graphics you want?
* Scripting Language - Do you know the scripting language of the engine? How powerful/flexible is scripting in the engine?
* Engine Support - How is the engine supported by its developers? Is free support available? Is support limited by price?
* Engine Community - Does the engine have a community of developers? Community can be a source of support, example code and plugins 
* Assets - Does the engine have an asset store/hub?
* Price/Licencing - Is the engine free? Is it still free for commercial use? Is a licence required to use the engine or sell games using the engine? 
* Open Source - Is the engine open source? Open source software may have faster bug fixes/upgrades, you may even be able to request specific features. It may also be less reliably supported and updated.
* Visusal/Drag'n'Drop/Scripting/Coding - How is scripting/coding within the engine handled? Drag and drop GUI with short attached scripts or more coding? Which do you prefer?
* Specific/Exclusive Features - are there any features you require which are not available in every engine?
